# QR-reader-and-Attendance-system

- **Developed a QR code reader application** using Python, OpenCV, and Pyzbar, capable of detecting and decoding QR codes in images.
- **Integrated Pyzbar library for QR code decoding**, extracting essential data like QR code content, rectangular boundaries, and polygon points for each detected code.
- **Implemented real-time visual feedback** by drawing rectangles and polygons around detected QR codes, enhancing readability and identification in processed images.
- **Utilized OpenCV for image processing** and rendering, including reading images from directories, converting color spaces, and displaying results with Matplotlib.
- **Designed a flexible input handling system** to process multiple images sequentially from a specified directory, supporting batch processing and scalability.
- **Displayed QR code data and coordinates** on-screen, providing a comprehensive output that includes both visual and data components for effective debugging and verification.
